By now you should have received a relatively formal email informing you that you have been put on our waitlist for admission to the Ph.D. program at Minnesota. The purpose of this less formal email is to hopefully preempt a few questions of yours.

Where am I on the waitlist?:  Unfortunately, you are  pretty far down our waitlist.  While this is not certain, it is my expectation that you will NOT be offered admission to our program.  While I understand this is disappointing, I hope this information coming sooner will make your planning easier.   This also means that in the unlikely event that you do hear from us, it will almost certainly be very near to, or even after, April 15th.

Again, I'm sorry to be the bearer of bad news.

Sincerely,

Christopher Phelan, Professor and Director of Graduate Studies"

Our admission committee appreciates the significant time and effort that you and your recommenders made to submit your application for admission to our Ph.D. Program.  

Our committee members carefully reviewed your application.  Each year, the number of applicants seeking admission to the Ph.D. program in Chemical Engineering far exceeds the number of available openings, with the result that the competition for admission is very high.  We have had some difficult choices to make and do regret that the department is unable to offer you a place in our entering Ph.D. class of 2011-2012.  Thank you for your interest in Stanford University, and the rest of the faculty join me in wishing you the best in your pursuit of Ph.D. studies elsewhere."
