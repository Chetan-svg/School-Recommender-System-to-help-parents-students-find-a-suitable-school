We regret to inform you that we are unable to offer you admission at this time.

 

We did a comprehensive analysis of all of the candidates who applied to our program. We used the following criteria in evaluating the applications: (1) undergraduate record; (2) graduate record (if any); (3) GMAT/GRE scores and TOEFL/IELTS scores (where applicable); (4) ability to profit from academic work at the Ph.D. level, as evidenced by letters of recommendation, academic and business experience, and/or interviews; (5) interest in, and background to undertake an intensive research program; and (6) fit of academic and research interests between the applicant and the relevant faculty group. We do not use any single criterion to reach our decision. With nearly 500 applications and only a few openings in each area of study, over 95% of our applicants, many with excellent qualifications, had to be turned away.

 

We regret that we were unable to admit you to our program. We wish you well in your work and hope that you find it possible to continue your education elsewhere. Indeed, we hope to see you in our profession someday soon."

While we cannot respond to each applicant individually about the strengths and weaknesses of their application, you may find it helpful to know that the successful applicants had perfect or near perfect scores on the GRE, impeccable letters of recommendation, extremely high grades - especially in math and economic courses, and demonstrated evidence of research ability.  The committee also took into account the caliber of the undergraduate and/or graduate institutions attended.  Applicants are also compared against the pool of other applicants applying in the same year.

Thank you for applying to the University of Michigan's School of Information doctoral program.   Unfortunately, we are not able to offer you admission.  

We had 156 applications this year, many with extraordinary credentials.  Our decisions were based on a very thorough review, extensive discussion by the committee, and consultation with the rest of the faculty. We took into account a broad spectrum of factors:  grades and test scores, general educational background, prior experience, statements of interest, and letters of recommendation.  We looked for aptitude for doctoral study, commitment to research, and fit to the School.  Since our doctoral program represents a big commitment of faculty time and financial resources we are able to admit only a very small number of candidates.  

I'm sorry the news couldn't be better for you.  Because of the volume of applications received, we cannot provide individual feedback on our decisions. I wish you well in your future endeavors.
                
Sincerely,

Stephanie D. Teasley
Director of Doctoral Studies"
