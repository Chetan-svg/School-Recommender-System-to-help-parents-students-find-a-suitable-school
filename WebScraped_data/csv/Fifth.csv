Because everyone is making decisions about graduate programs at this point, we have asked those admitted to let us know of their decisions as soon as possible.   We should begin to identify openings in mid to late April and we will be in touch with you as soon as possible after that.
Please be aware that our recommendations must be approved by the Dean before the Graduate School Admissions Office sends you an official letter indicating your wait-list status.  Meanwhile, we want to give you a little extra time to think about your decisions.   Of course we understand that you may prefer to accept a definite offer from another program at this stage.  However, it would also be helpful for us to know whether you would still wish to enroll in our program if the opportunity comes through.  
We had nearly 170 applications, and the nature of our program means that we keep enrollment fairly low.  Placement on the wait-list means that you are among the thirty top applicants.  This might be somewhat encouraging even though we cannot give you any indication of the chances of admission at this date.

Unfortunately, we are unable to offer you admission to the PhD Program for Fall 2010.

As you probably know, the application process is quite competitive with many applicants considered for just a couple of slots. This year we will be admitting about 3-4% if our applicants. An applicant is evaluated based on the strength and breadth of academic background, experience, passion, aptitude, and ability to conduct research, GMAT/GRE scores, and letters of recommendation. This means that our decision mostly reflects the strength of your application vs. the other applications we received, rather than an evaluation of whether you can successfully complete a the PhD program at Olin.

I wish you the best in your career pursuits."
