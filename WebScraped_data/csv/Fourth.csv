Thank you for your letter.  After careful consideration, I regret to inform you that I am unable to accept your refusal to offer me
an admission in your department. 

This year I have been particularly fortunate in receiving an unusually large number of rejection letters.  With such a varied and promising field of candidates, it is impossible for me to accept all refusals. 

Despite Whitson's outstanding qualifications and previous experience in rejecting applicants, I find that your rejection does not meet my needs at this time.  Therefore, I will get admitted in your department this August.  I look forward to seeing you then. 

Best of luck in rejecting future applicants."

Thank you for your application for admission to the MA programme in Economics.  
I regret to inform you that your application has not been successful.
All applications are reviewed by the Department's graduate admissions committee.  Potential graduate students are evaluated on their academic background, letters of reference and ability to complete a graduate programme at UBC.  Because of limits in the availability of space, faculty supervisors, and financial resources, admission to our programme is very competitive, and we are unable to accept many students who apply.
I hope that you will be successful in obtaining admission at another institution and achieve success in your studies."

I have not heard about my application yet! I have emailed and called them thousands of times and no answer! Butttttt finally someone answered my phone this week! A rude and impolite woman that explained that if there was any information, she would have known! She added that she could not do anything more. She didn't know with whom I may contact. She didn't know how long I should wait. She didn't know ....
Indeed she did know all of them but she loved being rude and unhelpful!

However this is just fun for me! I have already accepted an offer from a top 10 school and continue calling UNC just to have an estimation of how much unprofessional a program may be. 

They can not manage themselves, how they want to teach management to their students?"

We received over 430 applications for the doctoral study program this year and we can enroll fewer than 2% of the applicants. Our applicant pool is very strong; therefore we were unable to offer admission to many highly qualified students who would like to study here.

We appreciate your interest in the doctoral program and wish you every success in achieving your career goals.

I have submited a paper in mid March and it is now accepted. I'd say this paper helps much in the process. In fact, I'm not admitted in the first round, it is this paper that makes the professor interested in me. We talk about my paper and his paper through phone for nearly two hours before we commit each other.
